# Skipped tests

- [ ] All skipped tests should be fixed or removed

# Solver

- [ ] Logic conflict between Sword and Present
- [ ] If the user picks a fox, that should be cross-referenced with the candidate states to weight.

# UI

- [ ] Indicator for smart-filled tiles vs. user-entered tiles
- [ ] Mobile UI pin select popup to bottom
- [ ] General keyboard support; focus trapping in the popup
- [ ] Tooltips
- [ ] Empty tile icon
- [ ] Not uncovered tile icon
- [ ] Show foxes

# Problems

- [ ] If smart-fill can infer _some_ tiles, but not all of them, and the user has not entered any for that type of tile, the suggestion should be on the smart fill tile(s).
